# employee-looker-upper
a searchable employee directory


This one took a minute. At first I tried to write it using hooks, which as it turned out was a mistake. I'm still learning the hang of hooks and some things just weren't working quite right. Using classes seemed to be the way forward, and after that change, the app was working as intended. 

Ideally, this would be a little more polished, but mainly I'm just glad it's working!
